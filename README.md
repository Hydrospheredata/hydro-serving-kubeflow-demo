# Hydrosphere + Kubeflow Pipelines (Argo)

This example shows how to orchestrate a machine learning workflow with [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) and use [Hydrosphere Serving](https://hydrosphere.io/serving/) for model management. 

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to Kubernetes cluster
- [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/)
